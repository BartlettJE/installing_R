# Installing R/RStudio for Windows {#sec-installing-r-windows}

Installing R and RStudio is usually straightforward if you follow these steps. The sections below explain how to install R and R Studio on a Windows computer. If you prefer to watch a video showing the steps, [there is a helpful YouTube video here](https://youtu.be/H9EBlFDGG4k?si=NayiZj236I6KdTmY){target="_blank"} which covers installing on Windows. 

## RStudio desktop download page

Go to the [RStudio desktop download page here](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/){target="_blank"} which you can see in @fig-img-posit-install-windows. This is hosted by Posit - the company who create and maintain RStudio as an Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

```

They point you to two places to 1) install R and 2) install RStudio. 

## Step 1 - Install base R

The first step is installing base R. This is the software which contains all the functions and code you will use, but it is not very user friendly on it's own. We must first install R before we install RStudio. 

If you click <if>Download and Install R</if>, it will take you to the download page for R (@fig-img-R-CRAN-1).

```{r img-R-CRAN-1, echo=FALSE}
#| label: fig-img-R-CRAN-1
#| fig.cap: "Home page for the R CRAN site."
#| fig.alt: "The CRAN site has a white background with a blue R logo in the top left corner. In the middle of the screen is a list of download options for different operating systems."

knitr::include_graphics("images/R_CRAN_1.png")

```

You should click <if>Download R for Windows</if> and it will take you the download page (FIG). Highlighted in the black square, the top of the page will show the latest versions.

If you have an older computer which does not support the latest version of R, you can scroll down the page to see different versions supporting older operating systems, but please check with your course lead if you can only download an older version of R to check it is still suitable.

## Installation Location

It can often cause problems to install R on a network or cloud drive, such as OneDrive or DropBox. It's better to install these programs on your computer's drive. Depending on your computer's settings, you may have to get IT support to give you access to installing programs. 

It can also cause rare, but hard-to-debug problems if any of the folders in the `r glossary("path")` where you install R have non-Latin characters, including Chinese characters or Latin characters with accents (e.g., `C:\\DaniÃ«l\Programs\`).

## Step 2 - Installing RTools

After you install R, you should also install [RTools](https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/windows/Rtools/){target="_blank"}; use the "recommended" version highlighted near the top of the list. RTools is used for installing and loading some packages. You can get started without installing RTools, but if you are having problems with installing and loading some packages, this should be the first thing you try.

## Step 3 - Install RStudio

If you closed the page down, go back to the [RStudio desktop download page here](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/){target="_blank"} which you can see in @fig-img-posit-install-windows.

This page should recognise what your operating system (OS) is and the blue button will be customised to your OS. So, for a Windows user, it should prompt you to download RStudio for Windows. Clicking this link will start downloading the file to your downloads folder. 

## Getting help for installation problems

If you have any problems with installing R and R Studio on your computer, please attend the graduate teaching assistant support sessions for your course, speak to your course lead, or post on the Teams channel for your course/programme.
