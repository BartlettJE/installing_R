The sections below explain how to install R and R Studio on a Mac. If you prefer to watch a video showing the steps, [there is a helpful YouTube video here](https://youtu.be/I5WIMX4LK8M?si=s1ZTwKx0K2HoWAws){target=\"_blank\"} which covers installing on a Mac. \n\n## RStudio desktop download page\n\nGo to the [RStudio desktop download page here](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/){target=\"_blank\"} which you can see in @fig-img-posit-install. This is hosted by Posit - the company who create and maintain RStudio as an Integrated Development Environment (IDE).\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Install R and Install RStudio page on posit.co.](images/posit_install_page.png){#fig-img-posit-install fig-align='center' fig-alt='White background posit.co website for helping people install RStudio. On the left is a blue download and install R button. On the right is a blue download RStudio desktop for MACOS 12+ button.' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThey point you to two places to 1) install R and 2) install RStudio. \n\n## Step 1 - Install base R\n\nThe first step is installing base R. This is the software which contains all the functions and code you will use, but it is not very user friendly on it's own. We must first install R before we install RStudio. \n\nIf you click <if>Download and Install R</if>, it will take you to the download page for R (@fig-img-R-CRAN-1).\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Home page for the R CRAN site.](images/R_CRAN_1.png){#fig-img-R-CRAN-1 fig-align='center' fig-alt='The CRAN site has a white background with a blue R logo in the top left corner. In the middle of the screen is a list of download options for different operating systems.' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nYou should click <if>Download R for macOS</if> and it will take you the download page (@fig-img-R-CRAN-2). Highlighted in the black square, the top of the page will show the latest versions. If you have a new Mac with a silicon chip (if you are unsure <if>click the Apple logo in the top left > About this Mac > Chip</if>), click the top link to download the installation file. If you have an older Mac but latest operating system (OS), click the second link to download the installation file. \n\nIf you have an older Mac which does not support the latest version of R, you can scroll down the page to see different versions supporting older OSs, but please check with your course lead if you can only download an older version of R to check it is still suitable. \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![R for MACOS download page on CRAN.](images/R_CRAN_2.png){#fig-img-R-CRAN-2 fig-align='center' fig-alt='The CRAN site has a white background with a blue R logo in the top left corner. In the middle of the screen is a list of download options for different Mac versions. The top download link will be the most recent version of R for the newest Mac OS.' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOnce you have downloaded the file, clicking on it should open the installation process. Click <if>Continue</if> on the first page (@fig-img-install-R-1).  \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![The first R installation window for Mac OS: Introduction.](images/install_R_1.png){#fig-img-install-R-1 fig-align='center' fig-alt='The first R installation window as a black and dark grey square. This page is for the introduction for what the installation includes.' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe next page (@fig-img-install-R-2) - Read Me - explains what R is installing on your computer. Click <if>Continue</if>.  \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![The second R installation window for Mac OS: Read Me.](images/install_R_2.png){#fig-img-install-R-2 fig-align='center' fig-alt='The second R installation window as a black and dark grey square. This page is for the read me which explains what the installation file includes and any computer requirements.' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe License (@fig-img-install-R-3) page explains the license R is covered under. Click <if>Continue</if>.  \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![The third R installation window for Mac OS: License.](images/install_R_3.png){#fig-img-install-R-3 fig-align='center' fig-alt='The third R installation window as a black and dark grey square. This page explains the license which R is released under.' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAfter clicking <if>Continue</if> on the License page, it will ask you to agree to the licence (@fig-img-install-R-4). Click <if>Agree</if>.  \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Agreeing to the R user license.](images/install_R_4.png){#fig-img-install-R-4 fig-align='center' fig-alt='The license window pops out as another black and dark grey square. You can agree or disagree to the license terms.' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-warning}\n## Installation location and path\n\nOn a Mac, it should automatically choose a location to install R and skip Destination Select, but if you do get the option it can often cause problems to install R on a network or cloud drive, such as OneDrive or DropBox. It is better to install these programs on your computer's drive. Depending on your computer's settings, you may have to get IT support to give you access to installing programs if you are using a work computer with restrictions. \n\n:::\n\nThe Installation Type (@fig-img-install-R-5) page explains how much memory the R install takes up on your computer. Click <if>Install</if>. \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![The fourth R installation window for Mac OS: Installation Type.](images/install_R_5.png){#fig-img-install-R-5 fig-align='center' fig-alt='The fourth R installation window as a black and dark grey square. This page explains the memory R takes up on your computer. Here: 117.6 MB.' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nDepending on your computer, it will take a few seconds to a few minutes, and show as installation successful (@fig-img-install-R-6). Click <if>Close</if>. \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![The fifth R installation window for Mac OS: Summary.](images/install_R_6.png){#fig-img-install-R-6 fig-align='center' fig-alt='The fifth and final R installation window as a black and dark grey square. There is a large green tick if the installation is successful.' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAfter you click <if>Close</if>, it should offer to send the installation file to the bin now it has finished installing (@fig-img-install-R-7). Click <if>Move to Bin</if>. \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Moving the R installation file to the bin.](images/install_R_7.png){#fig-img-install-R-7 fig-align='center' fig-alt='After closing the R installation file, you see a small pop-out in dark grey. It asks you to keep the file or move it to the bin.' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIf you followed all of these steps, then you should have R successfully installed on your computer. You do not need to open it as we never actually use R on it's own, but you need it installed before we download and install RStudio.\n\n## Step 2 - Install RStudio\n\nIf you closed the page down, go back to the [RStudio desktop download page here](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/){target=\"_blank\"} which you can see in @fig-img-posit-install.\n\nThis page should recognise what your OS is and the blue button will be customised to your OS. So, for a Mac user, it should prompt you to download RStudio for a MAC OS. Clicking this link will start downloading the file to your downloads folder. \n\nIf you have an older Mac and you cannot download the latest version of RStudio, click on the <if>download a previous version</if> link. You will see a list of previous versions under the RStudio IDE / Workbench heading. \n\nOnce the download has finished (depending on your computer and WiFi a few minutes to around 15 minutes), it will open in a folder (@fig-img-install-RStudio). If you drag the white and blue RStudio logo into your Applications, you will be able to access it from your Applications folder. \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Dragging the RStudio installation file to the applications.](images/RStudio_install.png){#fig-img-install-RStudio fig-align='center' fig-alt='After downloading the RStudio installation file, the white and blue RStudio file will open in a folder. Next to it, you can drag the file to the blue Applications folder.' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWhen you open it for the first time, we recommend pinning it to your Dock (<if> control key and click > Options > Keep in Dock</if>) so you always know where to find it. \n\nIf you have successfully installed R and RStudio, you should see a fresh RStudio window (@fig-img-RStudio-fresh) when you open it from Applications or your Dock. \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Default white theme RStudio window.](images/Fresh_RStudio.png){#fig-img-RStudio-fresh fig-align='center' fig-alt='If the installation is successful, you can open RStudio as a piece of software on your computer. With default settings, it will open as a white background with three main windows: Console, Environment, and Files. ' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nYou are now ready to start working with R/RStudio from your course materials! \n\n## Getting help for installation problems\n\nIf you have any problems with installing R and R Studio on your computer, please attend the graduate teaching assistant support sessions for your course, speak to your course lead, or post on the Teams channel for your course/programme. \n\n",
