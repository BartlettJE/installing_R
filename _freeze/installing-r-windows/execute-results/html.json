The sections below explain how to install R and R Studio on a Windows computer. If you prefer to watch a video showing the steps, [there is a helpful YouTube video here](https://youtu.be/H9EBlFDGG4k?si=NayiZj236I6KdTmY){target=\"_blank\"} which covers installing on Windows. \n\n## RStudio desktop download page\n\nGo to the [RStudio desktop download page here](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/){target=\"_blank\"} which you can see in @fig-img-posit-install-windows. This is hosted by Posit - the company who create and maintain RStudio as an Integrated Development Environment (IDE).\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Install R and Install RStudio page on posit.co.](images/posit_install_page_windows.png){#fig-img-posit-install-windows fig-align='center' fig-alt='White background posit.co website for helping people install RStudio. On the left is a blue download and install R button. On the right is a blue download RStudio desktop for Windows button.' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThey point you to two places to 1) install R and 2) install RStudio. \n\n## Step 1 - Install base R\n\nThe first step is installing base R. This is the software which contains all the functions and code you will use, but it is not very user friendly on it's own. We must first install R before we install RStudio. \n\nIf you click <if>Download and Install R</if>, it will take you to the download page for R (@fig-img-R-CRAN-1).\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Home page for the R CRAN site.](images/R_CRAN_1.png){#fig-img-R-CRAN-1 fig-align='center' fig-alt='The CRAN site has a white background with a blue R logo in the top left corner. In the middle of the screen is a list of download options for different operating systems.' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nYou should click <if>Download R for Windows</if> and it will take you the R for Windows page (@fig-img-R-CRAN-windows-2). Click <if>Base</if> for installing R the first time. \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![R for Windows on the CRAN site.](images/R_CRAN_2_windows.png){#fig-img-R-CRAN-windows-2 fig-align='center' fig-alt='The CRAN site has a white background with a blue R logo in the top left corner. In the middle of the screen is a list of download options for Windows including base and Rtools.' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis will take you to the Windows download page (@fig-img-R-CRAN-windows-3). Click <if>Download R for Windows</if> at the top of the page. This will be the latest version available to you and it will start downloading to your downloads folder. Double click on the file when it has finished downloading.  \n\nIf you have an older computer which does not support the latest version of R, you can select a different version supporting older operating systems from the <if>Previous releases</if> link, but please check with your course lead if you can only download an older version of R to check it is still suitable. \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![R download page on CRAN.](images/R_CRAN_3_windows.png){#fig-img-R-CRAN-windows-3 fig-align='center' fig-alt='The CRAN site has a white background with a blue R logo in the top left corner. At the top of the page is a blue download R-4.4.1 for windows link to start the download process.' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOnce you have double clicked the installation file, the first window (@fig-img-install-r-windows-1) will get you to confirm the setup language. Click <if>OK</if>. \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![R installation process: Select setup language.](images/install_R_1_windows.png){#fig-img-install-r-windows-1 fig-align='center' fig-alt='The installation screen is a white and grey box.

Click <if>Next</if>. \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![R installation process: Information.](images/install_R_2_windows.png){#fig-img-install-r-windows-2 fig-align='center' fig-alt='The installation screen is a white and grey box. Here, the information page lets you scroll through the license and explains what R installs.' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe destination location window (@fig-img-install-r-windows-3) will ask you to confirm where it should install R to. It is **important** this installs to your `C:` drive which should be the default. Click <if>Next</if>. \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![R installation process: Select destination location.](images/install_R_3_windows.png){#fig-img-install-r-windows-3 fig-align='center' fig-alt='The installation screen is a white and grey box. Here, the select destination page lets you browse through your computer files to choose a folder to save R in. The default should be a C: drive.' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-caution}\n## Installation Location\n\nIt can often cause problems to install R on a network or cloud drive, such as OneDrive or DropBox. It's better to install these programs on your computer's drive (`C:`). Depending on your computer's settings, you may have to get IT support to give you access to installing programs. \n\nIt can also cause rare, but hard-to-debug problems if any of the folders in the <a class='glossary'>path<span class='def'></span></a> where you install R have non-Latin characters, including Chinese characters or Latin characters with accents (e.g., `C:\\\\DaniÃ«l\\Programs\\`). Try and avoid these wherever possible.\n:::\n\nThe select components window (@fig-img-install-r-windows-4) lets you select which components it should install, but leave these all ticked. Click <if>Next</if>. \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![R installation process: Select components.](images/install_R_4_windows.png){#fig-img-install-r-windows-4 fig-align='center' fig-alt='The installation screen is a white and grey box. Here, select components page allows you to select what is installed. There should be three default boxes ticked for main files, 64-bit files, and message translations.' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe startup options window (@fig-img-install-r-windows-5) asks if you want to customise the startup options, but leave this as No for the default options. Click <if>Next</if>. \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![R installation process: Startup options.](images/install_R_5_windows.png){#fig-img-install-r-windows-5 fig-align='center' fig-alt='The installation screen is a white and grey box. Here, startup options allows you to customise the options, but the default should be no.' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe select additional tasks window (@fig-img-install-r-windows-6) asks if you want to add any additional steps in the installation process, but leave these ticked/unticked as default. Click <if>Next</if> to start the installation process. \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![R installation process: Select additional tasks.](images/install_R_6_windows.png){#fig-img-install-r-windows-6 fig-align='center' fig-alt='The installation screen is a white and grey box. Here, you can select shortcuts to create for R which should be unticked, and two registry entries which should be ticked.' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nDepending on your computer, it will take a few seconds to a few minutes to successfull install R (@fig-img-install-r-windows-7). Click <if>Finish</if> to complete this part of the process. \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Complete R installation process.](images/install_R_7_windows.png){#fig-img-install-r-windows-7 fig-align='center' fig-alt='The complete installation process is a white box confirming you have completed the setup process.' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIf you followed all of these steps, then you should have R successfully installed on your computer. You do not need to open it as we never actually use R on it's own, but you need it installed before we download and install RStudio.\n\n## Step 2 - Installing RTools\n\nThis is technically an optional step, but after you install R it is a good idea to install [RTools](https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/windows/Rtools/){target=\"_blank\"}. You can get started without installing RTools, but if you are having problems with installing and loading some packages, this should be the first thing you try.\n\nIf you go back to the R for Windows page (@fig-img-R-CRAN-windows-2). This time, click <if>RTools</if> and it will take you to the RTools download page (@fig-img-RTools-CRAN-1). Click the top <if>RTools</if> option for the latest release. If you had to install an older version of R in Step 1, select a version of RTools consistent with the version of R you installed. \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![RTools page on the R CRAN site.](images/RTools_CRAN.PNG){#fig-img-RTools-CRAN-1 fig-align='center' fig-alt='The CRAN site has a white background with a blue R logo in the top left corner. On this page, there is a list of RTools versions to download, you should select the top most recent version.' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOn the Rtools for Windows page (@fig-img-R-CRAN-windows-2), half way down you will see an Rtools installer link. Click this link and it will start downloading to your downloads folder. Double click on the file when it has finished downloading to start the installation process. \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![RTools44 page on the R CRAN site.](images/RTools_CRAN_2.PNG){#fig-img-RTools-CRAN-2 fig-align='center' fig-alt='The CRAN site has a white background with a blue R logo in the top left corner. Half way down the page, there is a link to download the RTools44 file which is called Rtools44 installer.' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe first window will ask which folder on your computer you want RTools saving to (@fig-img-install-RTools-1). Like the R installation, the default should be your `C:` drive, and it is important you save it your computer's system files rather than in a cloud folder like OneDrive or DropBox. Click <if>Next</if>. \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Rtools installation process: Select destination location.](images/install_RTools_1.PNG){#fig-img-install-RTools-1 fig-align='center' fig-alt='The installation screen is a white and grey box. Here, the select destination page lets you browse through your computer files to choose a folder to save R in. The default should be a C: drive.' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe select additional tasks window (@fig-img-install-RTools-1) asks if you want anything extra in the installation process, but keep these ticked/unticked as the defaults. Click <if>Next</if>. \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Rtools installation process: Select additional tasks.](images/install_RTools_2.PNG){#fig-img-install-RTools-2 fig-align='center' fig-alt='The installation screen is a white and grey box. Here, the select additional tasks page lets you select two options. Save version information should be ticked and create start menu icon should be unticked bt default.' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe ready to install window (@fig-img-install-RTools-1) is the final step before the installation starts. Click <if>Install</if>. \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Rtools installation process: Ready to install.](images/install_RTools_3.PNG){#fig-img-install-RTools-3 fig-align='center' fig-alt='The installation screen is a white and grey box. Here, the ready to install page confirms the destination location and additional tasks before you click install.' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nDepending on your computer, it will take a few seconds to a few minutes to successfully install RTools (@fig-img-install-RTools-4). Click <if>Finish</if> to complete this part of the process. \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Complete Rtools installation process.](images/install_RTools_4.PNG){#fig-img-install-RTools-4 fig-align='center' fig-alt='The complete installation process is a white box confirming you have completed the setup process.' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nYou never need to do anything with RTools, it just exists in the background to help install certain R packages. \n\n## Step 3 - Install RStudio\n\nIf you closed the page down, go back to the [RStudio desktop download page here](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/){target=\"_blank\"} which you can see in @fig-img-posit-install-windows.\n\nThis page should recognise what your operating system (OS) is and the blue button will be customised to your OS. So, for a Windows user, it should prompt you to download RStudio for Windows. Clicking this link will start downloading the file to your downloads folder. Once it has finished downloading, double click on the file to start the installation process.\n\nThe first page of the setup process (@fig-img-install-RTools-1) explains what it will do and requests you close down other programmes first. Click <if>Next ></if>. \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![RStudio installation process: Welcome.](images/install_RStudio_1_windows.png){#fig-img-install-RStudio-1 fig-align='center' fig-alt='The first installation page explains what RStudio is installing and requests you close down other programmes. The box is white with a blue computer logo on the left.' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe install location page (@fig-img-install-RTools-2) confirms where on your computer it installs to. Like the other steps, this should be on your `C:` drive and be the default option. Just make sure it is not saving to a cloud drive like OneDrive or DropBox.
