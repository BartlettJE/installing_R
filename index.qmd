# Overview {.unnumbered}

In this guide, we demonstrate how to download and install the software R/RStudio on your computer which you will use throughout your degree. If you cannot download R/RStudio to your own computer, there is also a chapter guiding you through using the software on the library/lab computers. 

See @sec-installing-r-windows if you have a Windows computer. 

See @sec-installing-r-mac if you have a Mac. 

See @sec-library-computer if you need to use the library/lab computers. 

Every now and again, you need to update R/RStudio or the packages you use, so there is @sec-updating-r to support you there.
