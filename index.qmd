# Overview {.unnumbered}

In this R(eady)SetGo guide, we demonstrate how to download and install the software R/RStudio on your computer which you will use throughout your degree. If you cannot download R/RStudio to your own computer, there is also a chapter guiding you through using the software on the library/lab computers. 

See [Chapter 1](#sec-installing-r-windows) if you have a Windows computer. 

See [Chapter 2](#sec-installing-r-mac) if you have a Mac. 

See [Chapter 3](#sec-library-computer) if you need to use the library/lab computers. 

Every now and again, you need to update R/RStudio or the packages you use, so there is [Chapter 4](#sec-updating-r) to support you there. 

If you want to knit R Markdown files to PDF, you will need to install an extra package, so see [Chapter 5](#sec-install-tinytex).
