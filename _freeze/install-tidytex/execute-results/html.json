However, there is also an option to knit to PDF files. By default, it will not work on your computer unless you have software on your computer to compile a PDF file. \n\nTo generate PDF reports, the easiest way is installing [<pkg>tinytex</pkg>](https://yihui.org/tinytex/){target=\"_blank\"} and running the following code to install a lightweight LaTeX compiler:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# run this in the console\ninstall.packages(\"tinytex\")\ntinytex::install_tinytex()\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-warning}\nOn university computers, this is already installed and you should be able to knit to PDF. Please remember **not** to install packages on the university computers or online server as it can cause clashes between your user and system libraries. \n:::\n",
