For this reason, we recommend updating all your packages once at the beginning of each academic year (or semester) - don’t do it before an assessment or deadline just in case!\nTo update an individual package, the easiest way is to use the install.packages() function, as this always installs the most recent version of the package.\n\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n\nTo update multiple packages, or indeed all packages, RStudio provides helpful tools.

    "text": "4.4 Troubleshooting\nOccasionally, you might have a few problem packages that seemingly refuse to update. For me, rlang and vctrs cause me no end of trouble. These aren’t packages that you will likely every explicitly load, but they’re required beneath the surface for R to do things like knit your Markdown files etc.\n\n4.4.1 Non-zero exit status\nIf you try to update a package and get an error message that says something like Warning in install.packages : installation of package ‘vctrs’ had non-zero exit status or perhaps Error in loadNamespace(i, c(lib.loc, .libPaths()), versionCheck = vI[[i]]) :  namespace 'rlang' 0.4.9 is being loaded, but &gt;= 0.4.10 is required one solution I have found is to manually uninstall the package, restart R, and then install the package new, rather than trying to update an existing version. The installr package also has a useful function for uninstalling packages.\n\n# Load installr\nlibrary(installr)\n\n# Uninstall the problem package\nuninstall.packages(\"package_name\")\n\n# Then restart R using session - restart R\n# Then install the package fresh\n\ninstall.packages(\"package\")\n\n\n4.4.2 Cannot open file\nYou may get the following error after trying to install any packages at all:\n\nError in install packages : Cannot open file ‘C:/…..’: Permission denied\n\nThis usually indicates a permissions problem with writing to the default library (the folder that packages are kept in). Sometimes this means that you need to install R and RStudio as administrator or run it as administrator.\nOne other fix may be to change the library location using the following code (check in “C:/Program Files/R” for what version you should have instead of “R-3.5.2”):\n\n# change the library path\n.libPaths(c(\"C:/Program Files/R/R-3.5.2/library\"))\n\nIf that works and you can install packages, set this library path permanently:\n\nInstall the usethis package\nRun usethis::edit_r_profile() in the console; it will open up a blank file\nPaste into the file (your version of): .libPaths(c(\"C:/Program Files/R/R-3.5.2/library\"))\n\nSave and close the file\nRestart R for changes to take effect\n\nThe code in your .Rprofile will now run every time you start up R.\nAs always, if you’re having issues, please ask on Teams or come to office hours.\n\n\n\nUpdating RStudio\nUpdating packages with RStudio",

You can get started without installing RTools, but if you are having problems with installing and loading some packages, this should be the first thing you try.\nIf you go back to the R for Windows page (Figure 1.3). This time, click RTools and it will take you to the RTools download page (Figure 1.12). Click the top RTools option for the latest release. If you had to install an older version of R in Step 1, select a version of RTools consistent with the version of R you installed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.12: RTools page on the R CRAN site.\n\n\n\n\nOn the Rtools for Windows page (Figure 1.3), half way down you will see an Rtools installer link. Click this link and it will start downloading to your downloads folder. Double click on the file when it has finished downloading to start the installation process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.13: RTools44 page on the R CRAN site.\n\n\n\n\nThe first window will ask which folder on your computer you want RTools saving to (Figure 1.14). Like the R installation, the default should be your C: drive, and it is important you save it your computer’s system files rather than in a cloud folder like OneDrive or DropBox. Click Next.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.14: Rtools installation process: Select destination location.\n\n\n\n\nThe select additional tasks window (Figure 1.14) asks if you want anything extra in the installation process, but keep these ticked/unticked as the defaults.

So, for a Windows user, it should prompt you to download RStudio for Windows. Clicking this link will start downloading the file to your downloads folder. Once it has finished downloading, double click on the file to start the installation process.\nThe first page of the setup process (Figure 1.14) explains what it will do and requests you close down other programmes first. Click Next &gt;.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.18: RStudio installation process: Welcome.\n\n\n\n\nThe install location page (Figure 1.15) confirms where on your computer it installs to. Like the other steps, this should be on your C: drive and be the default option. Just make sure it is not saving to a cloud drive like OneDrive or DropBox. Click Next &gt;.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.19: RStudio installation process: Choose install location.\n\n\n\n\nThe start menu page (Figure 1.16) allows you to select where RStudio will appear on your start menu. The default will just be a folder called RStudio, so keep the default option. Click Next &gt;.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.20: RStudio installation process: Choose start menu folder.\n\n\n\n\nDepending on your computer, it will take a few seconds to a few minutes to successfully install RStudio (Figure 1.21). Click Finish to complete this part of the process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.21: Complete RStudio installation process.\n\n\n\n\nIf you have successfully installed R and RStudio, you should see a fresh RStudio window (Figure 1.22) when you open it from the RStudio folder in your start menu. So you can always find it, when you open RStudio for the first time by clicking on it’s blue and white R logo, right click and Pin to taskbar. This way, it will always be available via your taskbar at the bottom of the screen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.22: Default white theme RStudio window.\n\n\n\n\nYou are now ready to start working with R/RStudio from your course materials!",
